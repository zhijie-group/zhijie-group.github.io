**TL;DR:** 

LLM apps today have diverse latency requirements. For example, a chatbot may require a fast initial response (e.g. under 0.2 seconds) but moderate speed in decoding (only need to match human reading speed), whereas code completion requires a fast end-to-end generation time for real-time code suggestions.

In this blogpost, we show existing serving systems that optimize throughput are not optimal under latency criteria. We advocate using **goodput, the number of completed requests per second adhering to the Service Level Objective (SLO)**, as an improved measure of LLM serving performance to account for both cost and user satisfaction.

To optimize goodput, we introduce prefill-decode disaggregation, aka splitting prefill from decode into different GPUs. We also build **DistServe**, which achieves up to 4.48x goodput or 10.2x tighter SLO compared to SOTA serving systems, while staying within tight latency constraints. We are integrating DistServe with vLLM to bring the technique to the community.

## Background: Throughput vs. Goodput 

Large language models (LLMs) are changing how the industry adopts AI technology in their services, but the cost of LLM serving remains high. To reduce serving costs, many companies today focus on maximizing the overall LLM serving system **throughput, i.e., the number of requests served per second (or rps)**, as a proxy to minimize **dollar per request ($/req)**. Almost all popular LLM serving engines like [vLLM](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html) and [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) use throughput as the only metric to compare performance with each other.

In reality, downstream applications come in different flavors. These LLM-based applications may have different latency requirements for user experience, hence dramatically different [**service level objectives** (**SLO**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective) to satisfy. The most widely used SLO in LLM services are:

- Time to first token latency (**TTFT**): measuring the time taken for the LLM to respond the first generated token to the user
- Time per output token (**TPOT**): measuring the average latency between two subsequent generated tokens


{{< image src="img/diverse_slo.png" alt="diverse_slo" width="100%" title="Figure 0. Applications have diverse SLO.">}}


Throughput measures the number of requests or tokens completed across all users and requests, hence overlooking these latency requirements. We introduce **Goodput,** the number of completed requests per second that adheres to SLOs, and show it is a much better proxy metric measure dollars per request, because it captures request throughput under SLO attainment. 

To briefly illustrate goodput, assuming an application require TTFT < 200 ms and TPOT < 50 ms for at least 90% of the requests, we get the following definition:


Goodput (P90 TTFT < 200ms and P90 TPOT < 50ms) = maximum request rate per second when at least 90% of requests has both TTFT < 200ms and TPOT < 50ms

**Figure 1** shows a simple case where an application with high throughput may have a low goodput. The application has a throughput of 10 requests per second. But with the latency constraint, only 3 requests hold within the SLO constraint, yielding a goodput of 3 requests per second. As you can imagine, a user of this high-throughput but low-goodput serving system will still suffer from low quality of service and user satisfaction.

Let’s summarize the terms introduced in the subsection:

- **Goodput:** A measure of the effectiveness of an LLM serving system, taking into account both cost and user satisfaction. It is defined as the maximum request rate per second that the system can withhold while meeting a specified service level objective (SLO).
- **Throughput:** The number of completed requests per second processed by an LLM serving system.
- **Service level objective (SLO):** A set of targets that an LLM serving system must meet to provide a satisfactory user experience. Common SLOs include time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT), end-to-end latency (E2E), and exponential moving average (EMA) latency.
- **Prefill:** The first phase of LLM inference that digests all the input tokens, populates the KV Cache, and generates the first output token.
- **Decode:** The subsequent phase that generates token-by-token until termination.
- **Time-to-first-token (TTFT):** The time it takes for an LLM serving system to generate the first token in response to a user request. 
- **Time-per-output-token (TPOT):** The average time it takes for an LLM serving system to generate subsequent tokens in response to a user request.



## Why Existing Systems Fail to Achieve High Goodput? 

### How does an LLM request get processed?

Before we dive deeper, let’s revisit the lifecycle of a request in LLM serving. Figure 2 shows this process. When a request comes into an LLM inference engine, the LLM will first take the user input to generate the first token (**prefill**), and then generate outputs token-by-token auto-regressively (**decode**). A request usually consists of one prefill step, and multiple decoding steps until termination. 

LLM serving systems usually batch prefill and decoding all together using a technique called [**iteration-level scheduling**](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/yu) or [**continuous batching**](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/continuous-batching-llm-inference#continuous-batching), so that the GPUs process a batch size as large as possible, run one iteration, and generate one token for all of these requests. This technique effectively enhances the overall throughput (token per second) and is widely adopted in popular serving systems such as vLLM and TensorRT-LLM.

{{< image src="img/distserve-anime-colocate-crop.gif" alt="prefill_decode_process" width="100%" title="Figure 2. How requests get processed.">}}


However, **the two phases have very distinct characteristics in computation.** Prefill is very easily compute-bound, meaning a small batch of requests or even a long enough request will saturate computation very quickly. On the other hand, decoding needs a much bigger batch size to hit the compute bound, and is more easily subject to the memory-limit of the GPU. 

Due to their vastly different compute patterns and SLOs, colocating these two phases is not optimal for achieving high goodput because:

- Collocating prefill and decode causes Interference between them.

- Colocating prefill and decoding couples their resource allocation and parallelism strategies.

We explain them next.

### Collocating prefill and decode causes Interference

**Figure 3** shows a simplified view of the interference between prefill and decode. On the very left, we route the 2 incoming requests into two GPUs so that each request runs on their own. In the middle, we batch these 2 requests together in 1 GPU. We can see that continuous batching significantly elongates the latency for R1 (decode), and at the same time slightly increases the latency for R2 (prefill). On the right, we have a steady stream of incoming requests. Now the requests in the decode phase get “bugged” every single time a prefill requests come into the system, causing an unexpectedly long delay on decode. 

{{< image src="img/lvHuoscAJhmWUmO2hN9ENRxYpW83WJRNLpeDfX52JqjATOpwdCD72PwbcH6LvA_bCMrnqxHdhi7snoUEt8DvvrJKEUuaHdCayqNLPfied_43of9cedDSvAqrpLqRQz2m3v6BZUkwdlDadMlelK-PVfU.png" alt="continuous_batching_interference" width="100%" title="Figure 3. Continuous batching causes interference.">}}


As a result of this interference, when engineers want the system to meet the SLO of both TTFT and TPOT, they usually have to over-provision resources to meet the latency goal, especially when either SLO is strict. 

{{< image src="img/v-G1pP-L0ns16SwUSokflz3L116UBcfU3IRq7Os_TaGLndVns9GCGl0LpmuY-XsFTQL1Im_uTMEIE2el3mgHDNZ8c2V-3amPTmTXYQply3S3tSjQv6FGByJOyHZ8Kf5pDhlzcAh9NlDTuth_ZI4tqJU.png" alt="collocation_overprovision" width="100%" title="Figure 4. To meet SLO, system that collocates prefill and decode needs to overprovision resources to meet SLO target.">}}


### Parallelism strategy is coupled between prefill and decode

Moreover, with continuous batching, the parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/data parallelism) are naturally coupled in the prefill and decoding phase. However, as discussed previously, the computation pattern of prefill and decoding is very different, and their latency requirements also differ according to the specific application. As a result, the optimal parallelism strategy for prefill and decoding phase is usually different. For example, with a strict TTFT SLO and a loose TPOT SLO, the compute-intensive prefill phase prefers tensor parallelism (TP) to reduce the execution latency to meet the tight latency requirement while the memory-bound decoding phase prefers pipeline parallelism (PP) which has much lower communication overhead compared to TP.  



## New Approach: Disaggregation + Tailored Parallelism Strategy

The intuition is simple: disaggregating prefill and decode into different GPUs and customize parallelism strategies for each phase. This naturally solves the two problems above:

1. **No interference between prefill and decode** makes both phases faster and easier to attain SLO.
2. **Decoupled parallelism strategy** such that optimization can tailor for prefill and decode separately.

Figure 5 illustrates how a request is processed in such a disaggregated system. When a request arrives in the system, it first goes to a **prefill worker** and completes its prefill phase. After its intermediate states (mainly [KV Cache](https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249)) migrate to a **decode worker,** multiple decode steps are taken to generate subsequent tokens. The request leaves the system once it finishes generation. 

{{< image src="img/distserve_anime-crop.gif" alt="disaggregation" width="100%" title="Figure 5. How requests get processed when prefill/decode is disaggregated.">}}

Let’s go through a simple experiment to see why disaggregation is beneficial. We serve a 13B LLM on a single A100-80GB GPU with a synthetic workload of inputs of length 512 and output length 64 following [Poisson arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process). We gradually increase the request rates (x-axis) and measure how the two latencies (P90 TTFT and P90 TPOT, y-axis) change in Figure 6.

Suppose we set the SLO of P90 TTFT as 0.4 second and P90 TPOT as 0.04 second (the horizontal line in **Figure 6**). We observe the existing systems can support roughly 2.3 rps that stay within the TTFT latency constraint using 1 GPU, whereas for TPOT, it sustains 1.6 rps (**Figure 6a)**. Since we need to satisfy both constraints, the goodput of existing colocated system becomes:
$$
\text{	Goodput (colocate) = min(2.3, 1.6) = 1.6 rps (per GPU)
}
$$


The performance is significantly boosted after disaggregation. Prefill worker and decode worker can both achieve better rps than previous if only handling one phase – as shown in **Figure 6**, one prefill worker achieves roughly 5.6 rps and one decode worker achieves roughly 10 rps. 

More importantly, now we can **flexibly** allocate 2 prefill workers to pair with 1 decode worker (notate as 2P1D), 3 GPUs in total.The goodput becomes
$$
\text{Goodput (2P1D) = min(5.6 x 2, 10) = 10 reqs/s / 3 GPUs ≈ 3.3 reqs/s (per GPU)}
$$


**Simply disaggregating without any parallelism yields 2x goodput improvement.**

Collocation (a) has less flexibility than disaggregate (b) which allocates 2 GPU for prefill and 1 GPU for decode (2P1D).">}}

In fact, besides different resource allocation for each phase, disaggregating prefill and decoding further free us to pick the best parallelism strategy for each phase to optimize goodput (which we call “tailored parallelism”).

**KV cache transfer**

Disaggregation comes at the cost of the transferring intermediate states (i.e., KV Cache) between prefill and decoding GPUs. At the first glance, KV cache is a big memory expenditure in LLM inference, and the transfer of KV cache between GPUs over networks sounds like a bottleneck. 

We will however show **the exact opposite**: with proper placement, KV cache transfer overhead can be effectively minimized to be as low as less than the time of a decoding step, thanks to today’s high-speed networks such as NVLink and PCI-e 5.0.

To see this, assume we have 8-channel PCIe 5.0 x 16 (64GB/s per link) as the intra-node network. Given a request with 2048 tokens, we have the following estimation for transferring KV caches when serving OPT-175B:

Latency = 2048 tokens * (4.5 MB/token) / (64GB/s * 8) = 17.6 ms

This time is even less than one single decoding step for OPT-175B (about 30 - 50ms on A100). For larger models, longer sequences, or more advanced networks (e.g, A100-NVLink with a bandwidth of 600GB/s), the comparative overhead associated with KV cache transmission becomes much less significant relative to a single decoding step.

In conclusion, careful placement of prefill and decoding workers to utilize high-bandwidth networking can effectively hide the KV cache transfer overhead, which is discussed in detail in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09670.pdf).

### DistServe: Evaluate the effectiveness of Disaggregation

We implemented the proposed techniques in a system prototype, called DistServe, and compared it with existing systems on three workloads and datasets with distinct latency constraints: chatbot (ShareGPT), code completion (HumanEval) and summarization (LongBench). 

| **LLM App**     | **Data**                                                                              | **TTFT** | **TPOT** |
| --------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------- | -------- |
| Chatbot         | [ShareGPT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered) | Tight    | Medium   |
| Code completion | [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)                                     | Tight    | Tight    |
| Summarization   | [LongBench](https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench)                                       | Loose    | Medium   |

**Figure 8** shows the comparison of our system against vLLM as a baseline:

- **Chatbot**: DistServe sustains 2.0x - 3.41x higher goodput compared to vLLM.
- **Code Completion**: DistServe sustains 3.2x higher goodput and 1.5x more stringent SLO than vLLM. As a real-time coding assistant, the code completion task demands lower TTFT than chatbot, this leads to both systems ultimately being constrained by the TTFT requirement. However, by eliminating the interference of the decoding jobs and automatically increasing tensor parallelism in prefill instances through the searching algorithm, DistServe reduces the average latency of the prefill jobs, thereby meeting the TTFT requirements of more requests.
- **Summarization:** DistServe achieves 4.48x higher goodput and 10.2x more stringent SLO than vLLM. As expected, as vLLM colocate prefill and decode together, it experiences a greater slowdown in decode that fails to meet the TPOT requirement.

See our paper for more fine-grained experiment results.

### Disaggregation vs. Chunked Prefill

In this section, we compare prefill-decoding disaggregation to the recent approach known as dynamic splitfuse (alternatively, [chunked prefill + piggybacking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16369.pdf)), and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

The key idea of dynamic splitfuse is to split a lengthy prefill into smaller chunks, thereby forming a batch that fully engages the GPU by combining a chunk of prefill with several decoding tasks, a process referred to as piggybacking. The chunk size is deliberately chosen so that this approach can keep the GPU fully utilized at all steps to enhance overall system efficiency. However, it might introduce an increase in both TTFT and TPOT, potentially diminishing goodput under latency constraints. The challenge due to its inability to completely segregate prefill and decoding operations, leading to resource contention and a compromise between TTFT and TPOT.

**For TTFT**, chunked-prefill causes overheads for prefill (hence high TTFT) **regardless of** chunk size. First, selecting a chunk size significantly below the GPU's saturation point prolongs the execution duration of prefill tasks. For instance, assuming a GPU saturation at a prefill length of 512, setting the chunk size to 256 would double the TTFT for all prefills extending beyond 512. Second, even if the chunk size is optimized to nearly maximize GPU usage, chunked prefill significantly increases memory access for prefill tasks due to the necessity of loading the KV cache from GPU’s HBM to SRM for each subsequent chunk. This scenario escalates especially for longer prefills, translating to a quadratic increase in KV cache loading operations compared to a linear increase in the unchunked setup, and reducing opportunities for piggybacking due to limited decode token slots.

**As for TPOT**, as we have already revealed in [section 2](#background-throughput-vs-goodput), colcoating prefill and decoding in a batch inherently slows down all those decoding tasks.

In conclusion, chunked prefill may be promising in maximizing the overall system throughput, but when the application does not want to tradeoff between TTFT and TPOT but to adhere to both, disaggregation emerged as a better choice.



## DistServe Today

We are working with vLLM community to integrate the presented techniques into production LLM serving systems. 

Concurrent to our work, [Splitwise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/splitwise-improves-gpu-usage-by-splitting-llm-inference-phases/), [TetriInfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11181.pdf) and [DéjàVu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01876) also adopted this disaggregation strategy to separate prefill from decode to achieve better LLM serving goodput. We are excited to see many research and companies adopting disaggregation to optimize system goodput, and we believe that disaggregation will soon become the de facto choice for LLM serving engine.
